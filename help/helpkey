CMD - This key is the primary key for changing the effects of other keys on
    the keyboard.  When this key is depressed, the cursor goes to the
    bottom of the screen and "CMD:" appears.  A string-type command or a
    function key may be entered.  For example, the +PAGE key may be
    preceeded by the CMD key, causing the editor to display the top of the
    current file.
~1
WIN LEFT - This key causes the window to move to the left 16 spaces.  If the
    leftmost column is already column one, this key has no effect.  If
    preceeded by the CMD key, the window is moved all the way to the left.
~2
ALT - This key switches the window between the current file and its
    alternate file.
~3
INT - This key causes the an interruption in whatever may be going on in
    the editor.  It may be used for halting a fill or justify command, or a
    replay.
~4
OPEN (Insert Line) - This key causes a single blank line to be opened above
    the cursor's current position.
~5
-SRCH - This key causes the editor to search the buffer from the current
    cursor location backwards to find a match for the contents of the match
    buffer.  If preceeded by the CMD key, -SRCH will first load the search
    buffer with the word that it is resting on (from the cursor loc to the
    next white space), and then search backwards for it.
~6
CLOSE (Delete Line) - This key will copy the current line (or area) to the
    close buffer and remove it from the screen.  If MARK is used to
    delimit an area, the material to the right of the closed area will
    move to the left, filling it in.  If preceeded by the CMD key, CLOSE
    becomes UNCLOSE, returning the contents of the close buffer (same
    action as "insert close").
~7
MARK - This key will mark the cursor's current location.  This key is
    generally used to mark the top-left corner of a rectangular area before
    moving the cursor to the bottom-right corner (+1) and using OPEN,
    CLOSE, PUT, etc.  If preceeded by the CMD key, any marking is removed
    (UNMARK).
~8
LEFT ARROW - This key causes the cursor position to be shifted one
    character position to the left, without destroying any data on the
    screen.  When used following the CMD key, it becomes >LEFT, which moves
    the cursor to the left edge of the window.
~9
TAB - This key causes the cursor to be advanced to the next tab stop to the
    right.  If there is no tab stop to the right of the current cursor
    position, TAB is a no-operation.  When the editor is entered, tab stops
    are established by default to columns 1, 9, 17,..., and may be changed
    with the S/RTAB key and the typed commands "tab" and "tabs".
~10
DOWN ARROW - This key causes the cursor to be moved down one character
    position.  If the cursor was on the last line of the window, the window
    is redrawn to include the next line.  When used following CMD, this key
    becomes >DOWN, which moves the cursor straight down to the last line
    displayed on the window.
~11
HOME - This key moves the cursor to the uppermost left character position
    on the current window.  When used following CMD, it becomes >HOME,
    which moves the cursor the leftmost position on the last line displayed
    in the current window.
~12
PICK - This key will cause the area described (see MARK) to be copied to
    the pick buffer, and no change to the screen occurs.  When this key
    follows the CMD key, it becomes PUT, which causes the contents of the
    the pick buffer to be copied into the text at the current cursor
    position.  Any text formerly residing there is moved down if the pick
    buffer contains whole lines, or to the right, if the buffer contains an
    area.
~14
UP ARROW - This key causes the cursor to be moved up one character
    position.  If the cursor was on the first line of the window, the
    window is redrawn to include the preceeding line.  When used following
    CMD, this key becomes >UP, which moves the cursor straight up to the
    top line displayed on the window.
~15
INSRT - This key causes the editor to enter/exit the text-insert mode, in
    which data entered on the keyboard is inserted into the current line,
    rather than overwriting the data at the current cursor location.  The
    INSERT flag will appear on the info line at the bottom of the screen
    when the editor is in the insert mode.
~16
REPL - This key is used with the interactive replace command to cause the
    actual replacement to take place.  In normal operation, an interactive
    replacement command of the form CMD "replace interactive /str1/str2/"
    RETURN (usually abbreviated to CMD "rep i /str1/str2/" RETURN) is
    executed, and then the +SRCH and -SRCH keys are used to position the
    cursor at the occurance of str1 where the replacement is desired.  If
    REPL is pressed at this time, str2 is substituted for str1 at that
    location.
~17
-PAGE - This key will cause the window to move upwards in the text by one
    window length, bringing the data preceeding the current window into
    view.  When used following the CMD key, it becomes >-PAGE, which sets
    the window such that the first line in the file is at the top of the
    window.
~18
+SRCH - This key causes the editor to search the buffer from the current
    cursor location forwards to find a match for the contents of the match
    buffer.  If preceeded by the CMD key, +SRCH will first load the search
    buffer with the word that it is resting on (from the cursor loc to the
    next white space), and then search forwards for it.
~19
WIN RIGHT - This key will cause the window to be moved to the right 16
    character positions in the text.  If used following the CMD key +WIN
    RIGHT causes the window to be moved to the right until the end of the
    longest line if the current window is exposed.
~20
+LINES - This key causes the window to be moved downwards in the text about
    a third of the current window's length.
~21
DELCH - This keys causes the character at the current cursor position to be
    closed (that is, deleted, with the characters to the right moving left
    to fill in the space).  If used following the CMD key, it becomes
    +DELCH, which closes the current character and all characters to the
    right of it on the line.
~22
RWORD - This key causes the cursor to seek to the right for the beginning
    of the next word.  If there is no word to the right on the current
    line, the search continues on the next line.
~23
-LINES - This key causes the window to be moved upwards in the text about a
    third of the current window's length.
~24
LWORD - This key causes the cursor to seek to the left for the beginning of
    the previous word. If no word exists to the left of the cursor, it will
    "wrap around" to the last word of the preceeding line.
~25
+PAGE - This key will cause the window to move downwards in the text by one
    window length, bringing the data following the current window into
    view.  When used following the CMD key, it becomes >+PAGE, which sets
    the window such that the last line in the file is in view.
~26
CHWIN - This key causes the current window to be moved into the background,
    and the next window (in the sense of creation order) to be moved into
    the foreground for editing.
~27
S/RTAB - This key causes a tab stop to be set at the column that the cursor
    is on.  If the key is preceeded by the CMD key, any tab stop at the
    cursor's location is reset.
~28
CTRLQ - This key causes the next character (in the ascii range @-_) to be
    converted into a control character (in the range NUL-US) and inserted
    into the buffer, regardless of its meaning to the editor.  Normally,
    the use of this key causes some kind of offbeat character to appear on
    the screen, and then the letter itself.  For example, the sequence
    CTRLQ-G causes a BEL character to be entered into the text.  When text
    containing control characters is edited, the embedded control
    characters are displayed in the same manner (the exception is HT
    (ctrl-I), which is expanded to blanks by the editor).
~29
-TAB - This character causes the cursor to be moved backwards to the next
    preceeding tab stop on the current line.  If there is no tab stop to
    the left of the cursor, no action takes place.
~30
DEL - This character has many uses, depending on whether it was preceeded by
    the CMD key, and whether the editor is in insert mode:

    non-insert mode   no CMD key     replace the character to the left of the
				     cursor with a blank.
		      CMD key        replace all characters to the left of the
				     cursor with blanks.
    insert mode       no CMD key     close the character to the left of the
				     cursor position.
		      CMD key        close all the characters to the left of
				     the cursor location.
~31
RIGHT ARROW - This key causes the cursor position to be shifted one
    character position to the right, without destroying any data on the
    screen.  When used following the CMD key, it becomes >RIGHT, which
    moves the cursor to the right of the last nonblank characteron the
    line.  If it was allready in that position, >RIGHT moves the cursor to
    the right margin.
~129
ERASE - This key will erase the contents of the current line, leaving the
    blank line in the text.  If this key follows the CMD key, an UNERASE is
    done, copying the latest erased data back into the text.
~130
This key (whatever it was) is not implemented as an editor command.
~131
SPLIT - This key splits the current line into two, breaking the text just
    preceeding the cursor's current location.
~132
JOIN - This key causes the next line of text to be appended to the current
    line.  Any white space at the beginning of the next line is deleted,
    and a single space is inserted between the lines.
~133
EXIT - This key causes the editor to update the edited file and return
    control to the shell.
~134
ABORT - This key causes the editor to not update the current file, but
    simply close all files and return to the shell.  If the editor is
    invoked in the same directory afterwards, the editor will sense that
    the last time it was invoked it aborted, and request from the user what
    he wishes to do about that.
~135
REDRAW - This key will cause the screen to be redrawn.
~136
CTABS - This key causes all tab stops to be deleted.
~137
CENTER - This key will cause the current line to be centered within the
    current declared width of the file (default is 75 characters).
~138
FILL - This key will cause the lines from the current line to the next
    blank line to be filled within the current page width (default is 75
    characters).
~139
JUST - This key will cause the lines from the current line to the next
    blank line to be justified within the current page width (default is 75
    characters).
~140
CLEAR - This key is as yet unimplemented.
~141
TRACK - This key causes the track mode to be alternately entered and
    exited.  In the track mode any window movement command (+PAGE, RITE,
    etc.) will cause the same action to be taken on the current file and
    its alternate file at the same time, and thus they track one another.
    The presence of the track mode is indicated on the info line.
~142
BOX - This key causes a box to be drawn enclosing the marked area (see
    MARK).  The box is drawn with the characters +, -, and |.  Where a '-'
    is to replace a '|' character (or vice versa) a '+' is used instead.
~143
STOP - This key causes the editor to be placed in the stop state, awaiting
    a fg command to restart it.  Control is turned over to the C-shell.
~144
QUIT - This key causes the editor to be exited with no memory of the
    editing session.  All editing done during the session is lost.
~145
COVER - This key causes the current contents of the pick buffer to "cover"
    the text at the current cursor location.  The buffer data replaces the
    text data over the entire extent of the buffer.  If this key follows
    the CMD key, it becomes an PUT operation (see PICK).
~146
OLAY - This key causes the data in the pick buffer to overlay the text data
    at the current cursor location.  By this is meant that nonblank
    characters in the buffer replace text data.  If this key follows CMD,
    the effect is an ULAY (underlay), in which the buffer data replaces
    only blank data in the text.
~147
BLOT - This key causes the data in the pick buffer to blot the data in the
    text at the cursor's current location.  Blotting causes all data in the
    text which matches nonblank data in the buffer to be replaced with
    blanks.  If the CMD key preceeds this key, The effect is -BLOT, in
    which the blanks in the buffer cause blanks in the text.
~148
HELP - This key starts the help sequence.  What happens after it is pressed
    depends on the terminal that is being used, since the editor tailors
    the help sent to the terminal in use.
~149
CCASE - This key will cause the character under the cursor (or marked area)
    to change case.  This applies only to those characters which are
    alphabetic - no other characters area affected.  The cursor is moved
    to the right.
~150
CCAP - This key will cause the character under the cursor (or marked area)
    to be switched to upper case if it alphabetic and lower case.  No other
    characters are affected.  The cursor is moved to the right.
~151
AUTOF - This key alternately sets and resets the autofill mode, as
    signified in the info line.  Setting the autofill mode causes text
    typed into the editor to be line-filled automatically.  This means that
    as the words are typed, the one which causes the line to be too long
    will be erased from the current line, a new line opened, and that word
    and subsequent words will continue on that line.  Resetting the mode
    will cause data to be entered ontil the right margin is met, whereupon
    an error message will be displayed and no further text will be
    accepted.

    The left and right margins to be filled between may be set as follows:
    the left margin is by default the leftmost column of the window, but it
    may be changed by marking the desired column before entering AUTOF. The
    right margin is by default the current value of the linewidth, which
    defaults to 72, but may be reset to some other value by the "width=xx"
    option on the center, fill, or justify command.  If the CMD key is
    pressed before AUTOF, the location of the cursor at that time is made
    the right margin.  Note that doing so does not change the linewidth
    used for the center, fill, and justify commands.
~152
RANGE - This key, used with the <MARK> function, is used to delineate a
    range of lines within a file within which search and replace functions
    are to be limited. <RANGE> toggles the range mode; a flag at the bottom
    of the screen shows the state of the mode, preceeded by a <, =, or >,
    indicating respectively that the current line is before, within, or
    after the current range. If <RANGE> is used without <MARK>, the last
    range defined is reused (if one exists). The key sequence <CMD><RANGE>
    will display the line numbers that the range currently subsumes and the
    number of lines included. These will change when lines are added and/or
    deleted within the range.
~153
NULL - Nothing to be done
~154
DWORD - This key will delete the next word.  If there's no text remaining
    on the current line, a search is made for the next word, and that
    word is deleted.

PICK - This command will cause the area described (see MARK) to be copied to
    the pick buffer, and no change to the screen occurs.

`-pick
PUT - This command will  causes the contents of the the pick buffer
    to be copied into the text at the current cursor
    position.  Any text formerly residing there is moved down if the pick
    buffer contains whole lines, or to the right, if the buffer contains an
    area.

`close
CLOSE [ number ] [ linearea ]
    - delete lines or area.
    Without parameters the cursor line is deleted.

    With "number" parameter number lines beginning at the cursor are deleted.

    With parameter "linearea" the specified number of paragraphs or lines
    are deleted.

    With a "marked area" and no parameters the area is deleted and the
    material to the right of the closed area will move to the left,
    filling it in.

    The most recently deleted information is kept in the close buffer.

`-close
-CLOSE - insert the contents of the close buffer.
    It is inserted before the cursor line for entire lines otherwise at
    the cursor position.


UNCLOSE (UnDelete Line) - This command will returns the contents of the
    close buffer to be copied into the text at the current cursor
    position.  Any text formerly residing there is moved down if the pick
    buffer contains whole lines, or to the right, if the buffer contains an
    area. (same action as "insert close").

`blot
BLOT - This command  causes the data in the pick buffer to blot the data in
    the text at the cursor's current location.  Blotting causes all data in
    the text which matches nonblank data in the buffer to be replaced with
    blanks.

`-blot
-BLOT - This command  causes the data in the pick buffer to blot the data in
    the text at the cursor's current location.
    The effect is -blot in which the blanks in the buffer cause blanks
    in the text.

`help
HELP - This command  starts the help sequence.  What happens after it is
    pressed depends on the terminal that is being used, since the editor
    tailors the help sent to the terminal in use.

    For the IBM PC (MSDOS or Window 95 / Window NT), the following facilites
    are provided :

    Without command parameter or with
    "help keyhelp" command,
    the effect is to display the function associated with the key puched.
    To end a help key session the RETURN key must be used.

    The current keymap is displayed, and can can be dumped on a file by the :
    "help keymap" command.
    This function is by default assigned to Shift F5 key.

    Help on a given Editor Command can be displayed by the :
    "help <command name>" command.

    To navigate in the information on all the Editor Command use :
    "help cmd" or " help commands" command.

    To navigate in the information on all the Key Function use :
    "help keyf" or " help keyfunctions" command.

`dword
DWORD - delete word
    If the cursor is "on" a word, that word is deleted otherwise the
    next word is deleted. The deleted word can be restored by -DWORD.


`-dword
-DWORD - restore the last delete word.


`exit
EXIT - This command causes the editor to update the edited file and return
    control to the shell.

    Use with the "nosave" option : the file(s) are left
    unchanged, and the editing work is lost.

    Use with the "abort" option means that the file are not saved, but all
    editing action are saved in the keystroke file. The next time the editor
    is entered, the edit session can may be repeated using this keystroke
    file.

    The "quit" and "dump" option are reserved for the debuging of the Rand
    editor.

    The appropriate saves, cleanups done is defined in the followinf table.

ERASE [ number ] [ linearea ]
    - blank out lines or area.

    Without parameters the cursor line is blanked out (replaced by blanks).

    With "number" parameter number lines beginning at the cursor are
    blanked out.

    With parameter "linearea" the specified number of paragraphs or lines
    are blanked out.

    With a "marked area" and no parameters the area is blanked out.

    The most recently blanked out information is kept in the erase buffer.


`-erase
UNERASE - This key will un-erase the last erase, copying the erase buffer
    into the text, at the cursor position.

`range
RANGE [ number ] [ linearea ]
    - define a range for search and replace.
    Searches and replaces are limited to the defined range. Number and
    linearea specify the range from the cursor. One of them must be given
    unless an area has been marked, then the range is the area.

`-range
-RANGE - turn off previously specified range. The range no longer
    limits searches and replaces, but it remains defined.

    If a number or linearea are given, or if an area has been marked,
    the replacements are restricted to the area, otherwise they are made
    from the cursor position to the beginning of the file.

    If a range is in effect (set by the range command) the replacements
    are limited to the range.

    The show parameter will show the replacements on the screen as they
    take place.

    The interactive parameter will cause the command to stop when a
    texta has been found.
    The replacement by textb is then done when the REPL key is pressed,
    and the search for texta is continued when the SCH- key is pressed.
    A replacement may be skipped by pressing SCH- instead of REPL.
    Show and interactive may be abbreviated down to
    s, and i respectively.

    Any character that is not a letter or a digit may be used for delimiting
    texta and texta.


`-replace
-REPLACE [ number ] [ linearea ] [ show | interactive ] /texta/textb/

    reproduced in the alternate file, such that when the alternate file
    is made current its window will be positioned as if it had made
    the movements.

`-track
-TRACK - turn off tracking in the current window.


`update
UPDATE [ inplace | -inplace ]
    - editor exit control command
    The update command tells the editor what to do on exit with the

    or not to break links, the -update command causes any changes to
    the current file to be ignored.

`-update
-UPDATE [ inplace | -inplace ]
    - editor exit control command
    The -update command causes any changes to the current file to be
    ignored.

`window
WINDOW [ filename ]
    - create a window
    A new window is created as specified by the cursor position
    The cursor must be at the top or left edge of the current window.
    The new window is cut out of the current at the cursor.
    When filename is given the file will be in the window,
    otherwise the current file will be displayed.

`-window

    width n     sets the linewidth to n cols (for fill, etc.)
    wordelim "mode"     sets the action of the <+word> and <-word> keys.
		If mode is "whitespace" (the default), words are delimited
		by blanks and newlines, and the cursor advances to the
		first character following the delimiter.
		If mode is "alphanum", words are delimited by all special
		characters in addition to blanks and newlines, and the
		cursor advances to the first alphanumeric character
		following the delimiter.

    The "line", "page", and "window" options may be individually set in
    different windows.

`box
BOX - draw a box around the boundary of a marked area.

`caps
CAPS <marked area>
    - change lower case characters to upper case.
    Caps only changes the "target text"  - defined with the mark command.
    Only characters a-z are affected.


`ccase
CCASE <marked area>
    - convert case upper -> lower and vice-versa.
    The marked area is first defined by the "mark" key.


`checkscr
CHECKSCR - run a screen and keyboard mapping check facility. To return
    to the editting session the Escape key must be pushed.

`clear
CLEAR - Command not implemented yet !

`cover
COVER <adjust | close | erase | pick | run | box>
    Takes the named buffer (one of adjust, close, erase, pick, run, or box)
    and places the buffer over top of the text without moving anything.

`overlay
OVERLAY <adjust | close | erase | pick | run | box>
    Takes the named buffer (one of adjust, close, erase, pick, run, or box)
    and places only the printing characters in the buffer over top of
    the text without moving anything.

`underlay
UNDERLAY <adjust | close | erase | pick | run | box>
    Underlay is the reverse of OVERLAY, i.e. the buffer covers
    only the non-printing characters of the original text.


`blot
BLOT <adjust | close | erase | pick | run | box>
    Blot is like OVERLAY except that positions in the file corresponding
    to printing characters in the buffer are erased.

~-blot
-BLOT <adjust | close | erase | pick | run | box>
    -Blot is like BLOT except that positions in the file corresponding
    to blanks in the buffer are erased.

`insert
INSERT <adjust | close | erase | pick | run | box>
    Takes the named buffer (one of adjust, close, erase, pick, run, or box),
    moves the existing text to make room for it, and then inserts it at the
    current text location.
    It is identical to the -PICK command, except that now the other
    named buffers can also be inserted.

`delete
DELETE - delete the current file.
    The file is deleted from the system on exit from the editor.
    The delete can be nullified by exit with a parameter.

`goto
GOTO [ b | e | number | rbeginning | rend ]
    - position cursor on line specified.
    Parameter "number" specifies a sequential line number, parameter "b"
    means begin of file, parameter "e" means end of file, and no parameter
    means begin of file.

    "rbeginning" and "rend" specify the beginning and end of a range
    defined by the range command. They are valid even if the range has
    been turned off.
    Their shortest abbreviations are "rb" and "r"e, respectively.

`name
NAME <filename>
    - rename the current file
    The file being edited is renamed. The renaming takes effect when the
    editor is exited normally. It may be nullified by exiting with a
    parameter.


`open
OPEN [ number ] [ linearea ]
    - insert lines or area.
    Without parameters an empty line is inserted before the cursor line.

    With "number" parameter, number empty lines are inserted before the
    cursor line.

    With parameter "linearea" the specified number of paragraphs or lines
    are inserted before the cursor line.

    With a "marked area" and no parameters a blank filled area of that
    shape is inserted at the cursor.

`pwd
PWD - display full path name of the current directory in the message line.

`redraw
REDRAW - redraw the screen.
    The current screen is redrawn, free of possible messages not coming
    from the editor.


`regexp
REGEXP - enter regular expression mode for searching & replacing;
    While in regular expression mode, "RE" is displayed at the bottom
    of the screen.

    The regular expressions recognized are described below. This description
    is essentially the same as that for ed.

	A regular expression specifies a set of strings of characters.
	A member of this set of strings is said to be matched by
	the regular expression.  In the following specification for
	regular expressions the word `character' means any character but NUL.

	1.  Any character except a special character matches itself.
	    Special characters are the regular expression delimiter plus
	    \ [ . and sometimes ^ * $.
	2.  A . matches any character.
	3.  A \ followed by any character except a digit or ( )
	    matches that character.
	4.  A nonempty string s bracketed [s] (or [^s]) matches any
	    character in (or not in) s. In s, \ has no special meaning,
	    and ] may only appear as the first letter. A substring
	    a-b, with a and b in ascending ASCII order, stands for
	    the inclusive range of ASCII characters.
	5.  A regular expression of form 1-4 followed by * matches a
	    sequence of 0 or more matches of the regular expression.
	6.  A regular expression, x, of form 1-8, bracketed \(x\)
	    matches what x matches.
	7.  A \ followed by a digit n matches a copy of the string that the
	    bracketed regular expression beginning with the nth \( matched.
	8.  A regular expression of form 1-8, x, followed by a regular
	    expression of form 1-7, y matches a match for x followed by
	    a match for y, with the x match being as long as possible
	    while still permitting a y match.
	9.  A regular expression of form 1-8 preceded by ^ (or followed
	    by $), is constrained to matches that begin at the left
	    (or end at the right) end of a line.
	10. A regular expression of form 1-9 picks out the longest among
	    the leftmost matches in a line.
	11. An empty regular expression stands for a copy of the last
	    regular expression encountered.

`-regexp
-REGEXP - exits regular expression mode.
    While in regular expression mode, "RE" is displayed at the bottom
    of the screen.

`run
RUN - insert in the file the output of the defined command
    The standard output of the command (executed by the $SHELL shell)
    is inserted in the file at the cursor position.
    When an area of full lines has been defined by MARK, it is used as
    standard input for the command and is replaced by the standard output
    from the command. The FEED command can be used to insert the result
    instead of replacing the text.

`feed
FEED - insert in the file the output of the defined command
    The standard output of the command, executed by the $SHELL shell,
    is inserted in the file at the cursor position.
    When an area of full lines has been defined by MARK, it is used as
    standard input for the command. The RUN command can be used to
    replace the result instead of inserting the text.

`call
CALL - execute the shell command
    The output of the command, executed by the $SHELL shell, is displayed
    below the edit window. Entering RETURN key repaints the edit window
    to resume the edit session.
    The "SHELL command" is the same as a "CALL command".

`shell
SHELL - run the user shell
    Starts the shell defined by $SHELL. The outputs are displayed
    below the edit window. Exiting the shell (normaly by "exit" or "Ctrl D")
    repaints the edit window to resume the edit session.
    The "SHELL command" is the same as a "CALL command" : execute the
    "command" and return.

`justify
JUSTIFY [ width=number ] [ linearea ] - justify lines
    Justify lines, beginning at the cursor such that the last word on the
    lines ends at the right margin. With parameter linearea the specified
    lines or paragraphs are justified. With no linearea parameter one
    paragraph is justified. With no linearea parameter and a marked area
    of integer lines the area is justified.
    A line length of width is assumed, where width is the value specified
    with the most recent center, fill, or justify command (default 75).
    Width may be abbreviated w.
    The most recently justified lines are put in the
    adjust buffer in their original form.

`fill
FILL -fill lines beginning at the cursor
    Fill moves words so that each line is filled with words up to the
    right margin. Fill operates on paragraphs or on areas if one has
    been defined.

`center
CENTER [ width=number ] [ number ] - center lines
    Center lines beginning at the cursor such that there is the same
    amount of blanks on either side of the text. With no number parameter
    one line is centered, otherwise number lines are treated. With no
    number parameter and a marked area of integer lines the area is
    centered. The lines are centered individually. A line length of
    width is assumed, where width is the value specified with the most
    recent center, fill, or justify command (default is 75). Width may be
    abbreviated w. The most recently centered lines are put in the adjust
    buffer in their original form.

`-wp
-WP - exit "word processing" mode

`wp
WP - enter "word processing" mode
    WP mode enables power typing or "word wrap", where any text that is
    entered past the right margin (see "set rmar" above) is automatically
    placed on the following line at the left margin (see "set lmar" above).
    WP mode also moves the cursor to the left margin in response to
    a <RETURN>.
    WP mode is entered while a marked area is in effect, the boundaries of
    the marked area become the left and right margin settings.
    "WP" is displayed at the bottom of the screen in word processing mode.

`stop
STOP - Suspend the editor (the editor is placed in background state)
    Returns control to the shell, resume the editor with the 'fg' command.

`logoff
LOGOFF - Exit and logout if the editor is use as the login program

`logout
LOGOUT - Exit and logout if the editor is use as the login program

`search
SEARCH [ text ] - Search the buffer in forwards direction
    If text is defined, the match buffer is loaded with the text, else the
    previous value of the match buffer is left unchanged.  The editor
    searches the buffer from the current cursor location forwards to find
    a match for the contents of the match buffer.

`-search
-SEARCH [ text ] - Search the buffer in backwards direction
    If text is defined, the match buffer is loaded with the text, else the
    previous value of the match buffer is left unchanged.  The editor
    searches the buffer from the current cursor location backwards to find
    a match for the contents of the match buffer.

`?file
?FILE - displays some file satus information :

    File Style    : MicroSoft or Unix

    Current state : a string "LPRDNS.ICFDU"
		    If the state is set , the letter is shown,
			else a '-' replace the letter.

		    L = file pointed by a symbolink Link
		    U = Update this file on exit
		    R = file exists and will be Renamed on exit
		    D = file exists and will be Deleted on exit
		    N = desN't exist yet, will be created on exit
		    S = file was Saved during this session
		    . =               flag not used
		    P = to be saved in Place
		    C = file Can be modified
		    F = File is writable
		    D = Directory is writable
		    I = file entry In use

    File Style on save : (MicroSoft or Unix) if it will be different
			 from the current File Style

    File full Name (it can be truncated of the right side)

	MicroSoft file style use "cr lf" characters as End Of Line mark,
	Unix file style use "lf" as End Of Line.

`file
FILE <option>
    - set the curent file save style

    Option :        (character's case are not significant in command)
    MicroSoft   set save file style to MicroSoft
    MS-DOS      set save file style to MicroSoft
    MsDos       set save file style to MicroSoft
    Unix        set save file style to Unix
    ?           displays the current file state
		(same as the "?file" command)

    MicroSoft file style use "cr lf" characters as End Of Line mark,
    Unix file style use "lf" as End Of Line.

    The current file style is sample on the first line read from this
    file during the editing session.

    If this line is ended by "cr lf", the style is MicroSoft,
    else if it is "lf", the style is Unix.

    By default (on creatation) a file use MicroSoft style.

`version
VERSION - displays the program version and author.

`cd
CD - change the current directory to the given one. If no new directory is
    provided, change to the default one (the initial working directory).

`status
STATUS - display the current status of the editor.

#Linux_key_mapping ------------------------------------------------------
Recommandations for X key mapping on Linux :

  The following translation override is assumed to be done for nxterm
    application in "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/app-defaults/NXTerm"

  !       (the right side key pad) disturbe the normal behaviour of these
  !       keys as defined by the shift modifier.
  !   The new translation must be applied only to shift and lock_shift
  !       case (see the ':' in the translation defintion).
