E has been changed to handle aborted and crashed sessions better.
If E detects that either of those cases has occurred, you will be prompted
with some options and asked how you would like to proceed.  If you need the
editor to ignore whether or not a crash or abort happened, invoke:
    e -norecover

E now provides two new ways to exit:
    CMD: exit nosave
This is like normal exit except that no saves happen.  This is handy if you
want to be able to come back into the editor next time at the same spot but
don't want to save any files you may have modified.
    CMD: exit quit
This is like "exit abort", but deletes the keystroke file.  If you don't
plan to do a replay, then this is preferred over "exit abort".

		  saves   updates      deletes     deletes
		  files  state file   keystroke    'changes'
			   (.es1)    file (.ek1)  file (.ec1)
		  -----  ----------  -----------  -----------
    exit           YES      YES          YES         YES
    exit nosave     -       YES          YES         YES
    exit quit       -        -           YES         YES
    exit abort      -        -            -          YES
    exit dump       -        -            -           -

The "exit load" is obsolete and has been withdrawn.
