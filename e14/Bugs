If a -update comand has been issued for a file, a 'save' command is
a no-op, and you are not told.

On systems without exclusive open, some other sort of interlocking method
  should be attempted, to determine if multiple users are working in the
  same directory

No allocs should take place from the time that the user issues the "exit"
  command until E exits, because if an out-of-heapspace occurs during that
  time you're screwed.

Window comand sometimes writes first line of new window on CMD line.

Line # should be updated on a replace with the show option.

Command line doesn't get flushed out during replay of replace commands.

Fix what happens when command line too long.

Blot-@'s can remain on the screen image after a ^B; redraw doesn't help.

Should catch attempted replaces that will loop.
