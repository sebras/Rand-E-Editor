Unfortunately, these docs are riddled with
things for internal Rand use which will
probably just confuse you, like the naming of the keys,
and the references to NED did this, NED did that.

Also, in E14doc there is this false sentence:

A comprehensive guide to E has been written by David
Yost and Judith Westbury and will be published soon.

For more documentation, see ../e15/Changes and ../term/Keyboard
