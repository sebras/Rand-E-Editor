<A NAME="sect2" HREF="#toc2"><H2><B>DESCRIPTION</B></H2></A>
<I>e</I> invokes the Rand editor. The Rand editor is a full screen text editor with file editing in windows on the screen. Editing is done by typing directly into the window, and functions include &quot;cut&quot; and &quot;paste&quot; operations, simple formatting, and embedding UNIX command output in the file.<P>
The parameter <I>file</I> denotes the file to be edited and <I>altfile</I> is an optional alternate file. With no file names given the editor will resume the latest editing session in the directory, if any, otherwise it will prompt for a file name.<P>
<I>E</I> is a complete rewrite of the Rand editor <I>NED</I> The current version (E19) takes advantage of terminals that have the ability to do local insert/delete line. A reference manual <I>The</I> <I>Rand</I> <I>Editor</I>, <I>E</I>, <I>April</I> <I>1984</I> is available on the PRIAM VAX using the notesfile scheme and the printdoc command.<P>

<A NAME="sect3" HREF="#toc3"><H2><B>CHANGES</B></H2></A>
E19 changes include:<BR>
 - word processing mode (WP mode)<BR>
 - a delete word function<BR>
 - options to control the behavior at the right margin; - an alternate syntax for the &quot;goto&quot; command; - display of tab settings on the top border - left and right margin (width) settings on the bottom border<BR>
 - an option for invoking <I>E</I> with a previous state file - a new help facility;<BR>
 - improved support for the &quot;track&quot; command; - new commands for case conversion and reversal.<P>
E18 changes include:<BR>
 - support for regular expression searching and replacment<BR>
 - implementation of the +WORD and -WORD functions - a new <B>set</B> command to individually tailor various parameters<BR>
 - support for symbolic links<BR>
 - E now runs under UNIX System III and System V - commands that specify filenames (e.g., &quot; CMD: e file&quot; expand a leading &quot;~&quot; to the appropriate home directory;<P>

<A NAME="sect4" HREF="#toc4"><H2><B>OPTIONS</B></H2></A>
<P>
The currently available command line options are:<P>
<dl>
<dt>-<B>help</B><dd> This causes a display of the currently available options and their values along with the version number of the editor.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-<B>bullets</B> or -<B>nobullets</B><dd> Options -bullets and -nobullets forces border bullets on or off regardless of line speed or terminal type. Line speeds of 1200 baud and slower and some terminal types set border bullets off in the absence of these options.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-<B>inplace</B><dd> Option -inplace preserves file links except for singly-linked files. From within the editor, link preservation can be turned on and off, even for singly-linked files, by the update command.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-<B>terminal=termtype</B><dd> Option -terminal=termtype identifies the terminal type explicitly. In the absence of the -terminal option the terminal type is retrieved from the TERM environment variable.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-<B>keyboard=termtype</B> <B>or</B> -<B>dkeyboard=termtype</B><dd> Option -keyboard=termtype sets the keyboard type to &quot;termtype". It overrides any &quot;-terminal=&quot; argument and also any EKBD environment variable.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-<B>dtermcap</B><dd> Option -dtermcap forces <I>E</I> to use the termcap entry for the terminal identified by the TERM variable or -terminal option, disregarding any applicable compiled-in code.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-<B>notracks</B><dd> Option -notracks will allow you to edit a file without using or disturbing the work files (keys, state, and change files) from your previous session.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-<B>package=directory_name</B><dd> Option -package=directory_name allows you to overwrite the build in default directory in which the Rand editor is looking to find service programs (like just, fill) and messages and information files (like Crashdoc, helpkey). In the absence of the -package option the Rand package directory is retrieved from the RAND_PACKG environment variable.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-<B>replay=filename</B><dd><P>
</dd>
</dl>
Option -replay=filename allows you to replay with a specified keys file, where &quot;filename&quot; represents that keys file. Use -silent when the replay display is not desired. The message &quot;***replay completed&quot; or &quot;***replay aborted&quot; signals the end of the replay. The &lt;INT&gt; key can be used to stop the replay short of completion. Files .ec1* and .ek1* must not be present if the replay is to work.<P>
<dl>
<dt>-<B>norecover</B><dd> Option -norecover will open the edit session as defined by the .es1 state file, ignoring any recovery processing of a prior crashed or aborted session.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-<B>regexp</B><dd> Option -regexp enables regular expression pattern matching for searching and replacing. This mode is also enabled by the &quot;re[gexp]&quot; command. In regular expression mode, &quot;RE&quot; is displayed at the bottom of the screen. The command &quot;-re[gexp]&quot; returns to non-regular expression mode. The regular expressions recognized are essentially the same as that for <I>ed</I>.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-<B>state=filename</B><dd> Option -state=filename causes the initial state of the editor to be read from the indicated &quot;state&quot; file. The state file from a previous <I>E</I> session (with alternate files, windows, cursor positioning, etc.) may be saved by exiting, and renaming the state file (".es1").<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>-<B>[no]stick</B><dd> Option -stick sets the behavior at the right margin to stop in response to typing or a &lt;RT ARROW&gt;. -nostick is the default, and will automatically shift the window right in response to text or &lt;RT ARROW&gt; key.<P>
</dd>
</dl>

<A NAME="sect5" HREF="#toc5"><H2><B>TERMINAL</B> <B>TYPES</B></H2></A>
The terminal type is defined by the option -terminal if given, otherwise by the TERM environment variable.<P>
The mapping of the logical keys onto physical terminal keys is also defined by the terminal type, unless the EKBD environment variable is set to standard or the option -keyboard=standard is given. This option overrides the EKBD variable, if any.<P>
The instructions to drive the terminal may be coded in the editor or may be stored in the <A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man2html?termcap?5">termcap(5)</A> database. The parameter -dtermcap forces the use of <A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man2html?termcap?5">termcap(5)</A>.<P>
The following terminal types are recognised:<P>
<TABLE BORDER=2 CELLSPACING=1 CELLPADDING=1 >

where the right hand side gives the terminalid.<P>
<I>Terminal</I> <I>tables</I><P>
The following tables show function key assignments on the different terminals.<P>
<I>The</I> <I>Newbury</I> <I>7001</I> <I>terminal</I>:<P>
The terminal type must be set to <I>nb7</I> and ned needs a keyboard file which is used to map the newbury &quot;function" keys. This keyboard file is preferably set in the environment variable EKBFILE, currently the file is called /<I>etc</I>/<I>e</I>/<I>kbfiles</I>/<I>newbkb</I>.<P>
Before the Newbury can be used it must be set up locally by the user. He must check the terminal status page. This is done by putting the terminal in EDIT mode, press the EDIT key. Then press the CONTROL and HOME keys at the same time.<P>
The terminal must be set up with the following options: In the top status line: ... DELETE=Y;NL=NO... In the status page:<P>
<dl>
<dt>- All control characters allowed, no characters are<dd> underlined. - clear from home - clear on reset : yes - cursor skip : yes - attributes: protect = no, blink=no, underline=yes.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
Using the above mentioned keyboard file, the ned editor works as the following control keys table shows:<P>

<I>The</I> <I>TANDBERG</I> <I>2200</I> <I>terminal</I>:<P>
The terminal type must be set to <I>tdv</I> and ned needs a keyboard file which is used to map the TANDBERG &quot;function" keys.
This keyboard file is preferably set in the environment variable EKBFILE, currently the file is called
/<I>etc</I>/<I>e</I>/<I>kbfiles</I>/<I>tdvkb</I>. The assignments of the keys to editor functions as defined in
the keyboard file for the TANDBERG terminal is shown in the following table:<P>

There are no function  keys for WIN<- and WIN-> on a VT100 terminal.
	Use 'Ctrl-X Ctrl-H' and 'Ctrl-X Ctrl-L' instead.

<I>Rand</I> <I>editor</I> <I>standard</I> <I>keyboard</I><P>
The keyboard layout below is designed for terminals with no function keys.
&quot;^H&quot; means control-H, and &quot;^X-^U&quot; means control-X followed by control-U.
The ALT entry gives you a choice of `^/' or `^_' because one or the other or both will not work on some terminals.
Note that JOIN, SPLIT, and ERASE are now available as function keys.<P>

All of these commands take the named buffer (one of adjust, close, erase, pick, run, or box) and add or merge it into the current file.<P>
Insert takes the named buffer, moves the existing text to make room for it, and then inserts it at the current text location. It is identical to the -pick command, except that now the other named buffers can also be inserted.<P>
Cover places the named buffer over top of the text without moving anything.<P>
Overlay is like cover, except that only the printing characters in the buffer clobber the original text.<P>
Underlay is the reverse of overlay, i.e. the buffer covers only the non-printing characters of the original text.<P>
Blot is like overlay except that positions in the file corresponding to printing characters in the buffer are erased.<P>
<dl>
<dt>-blot is like blot except that positions in the<dd> file corresponding to blanks in the buffer are erased.<P>

This mode of operation may be overridden by marking the positions on the two lines that should be joined. Any lost text is put in the close buffer.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
justify [ width=number ] [ linearea ]<BR>
 <dl>
<dt>ju <dd>       - justify lines, beginning at the cursor such that the last word on the lines ends at the right margin. With parameter linearea the specified lines or paragraphs are justified. With no linearea parameter one paragraph is justified. With no linearea parameter and a marked area of integer lines the area is justified. A line length of width is assumed, where width is the value specified with the most recent center, fill, or justify command (default 75). Width may be abbreviated w. The most recently justified lines are put in the adjust buffer in their original form.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
name filename<BR>

With a marked area and no parameters a blank filled area of that shape is inserted at the cursor.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
pick [ number ] [ linearea ]<BR>
 <dl>
<dt>pi <dd>       - pick lines or area. Without parameters the cursor line is put into the pick buffer. With number parameter, number lines beginning at the cursor are picked.

replace [ number ] [ linearea ] [ show | interactive ] /texta/textb/<BR>
 <dl>
<dt>rep <dd>      - replace texta by textb from cursor and towards the end of the file. If a number or linearea are given, or if an area has been marked, the replacements are restricted to the area, otherwise they are made from the cursor position to the end of the file. If a range is in effect (set by the range command) the replacements are limited to the range. The show parameter will show the replacements on the screen as they take place. The interactive parameter will cause the command to stop when a testa has been found. The replacement by textb is then done when the REPL key is pressed, and the search for texta is continued when the SCH+ key is pressed. A replacement may be skipped by pressing SCH+ instead of REPL. Show and interactive may be abbreviated down to s, and i respectively. Any character that is not a letter or a digit may be used for delimiting texta and texta.<P>

WP mode also moves the cursor to the left margin in response to a &lt;RETURN&gt;. If WP mode is entered while a marked area is in effect, the boundaries of the marked area become the left and right margin settings.<P>

<A NAME="sect9" HREF="#toc9"><H2><B>FILES</B></H2></A>
<P>
,filename - comma file.<P>
The file being edited is left unchanged until a normal exit is made from the editor. The file is then copied onto a file with the same name preceded by a , (comma) and thereafter the modifications are applied. If no modifications are made or at abnormal exits (exit with a paramater) the comma file is not produced. For a file to be changed, it and its directory must both have write permission.<P>
<dl>
<dt>.ec1 <dd>     - change file. All changed text from the file being edited is collected in the change file. The changed text may be accessed as alternate files via the pseudo file names #o and #p, and text may be picked from them. The #o (old lines) file contains all original versions of changed lines. The #p (pick) file contains all picked text. Text picked from the #p file is not appended to it.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>.ek1 .ek1b <dd>- keystroke files. The files contain all changes made to the files being edited. The format is such that the changes can be applied when a normal exit is made from the editor. If an exit is made with parameter dump, or if the editor crashes, the keystroke files can be used for recovering the lost editing session. Recovery is done by invoking the editor without a filename, it will then present recovery options to the user. The file .ek1b is used in the recovery process.<P>
</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>.es1 <dd>     - state file. The state file contains information about the last file edited in the directory, including file name, the place in the file where the cursor were when the editor was terminated, the width value (center, fill, justify), the state (insert or normal), the tabulators and the last search string. When the editor is called without a file name the state file is used to recreate the situation that existed at the previous termination.<P>
