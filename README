RAND editor sources
===========================================================

This version of the rand editor currently compiles on the
following architectures:

- AIX    4.1
- Ultrix 4.4  (Need TERMCAP symbol in e19/Makefile)
- OSF/1  3.2

As it is there, it does look for special files in /ps/local/$OS/e
where $OS = AIX, ULTRIX or OSF1 (as reported by uname)

To modify this feature, there is a need to modify install files
and include/local_env.h
