RAND editor sources
===========================================================

This version of the rand editor currently compiles on the
following architectures:

- AIX    4.1
- Ultrix 4.4  (Need TERMCAP symbol in e19/Makefile)
- OSF/1  3.2

As it is there, it does look for special files in /ps/local/$OS/e
where $OS = AIX, ULTRIX or OSF1 (as reported by uname)

To modify this feature, there is a need to modify install files
and include/local_env.h


Linux installation and configuration :
======================================

The new version for Linux use a new way to found the keyboard configuration.

    - The full path name of the keyboard file is defined by
      (in priority order)
	1 - the value of "-kbfile" calling parameter (see --help output)
	2 - the value of "EKBFILE" environement variable
	3 - the "<pacakage configuration>/kbfiles/<terminal type file name>"
	    the "terminal type keyboard configuration file name"

    - The "terminal type file name" configuration is defined
	1 - the name of the terminal defined by
		i  - the value of "-terminal" calling parameter (see --help output)
		ii - the value of "TERM" environement variable
	    concanetated with the postfix "kb",
	    ex : linuxkb for the default linux console
	2 - "universalkb" if the specific file does not exist
	    or cannot be read.

    - The "pacakage configuration directory" is defined by
	1 - the user configuration directory : ".Rand" in the
	    user $HOME directory, ex : <toto home>/.Rand
	2 - the local system configuration directory : "Rand"
	    in the /usr/local/etc , ex : /usr/local/etc/Rand
	3 - the global system configuration directory : "Rand"
	    in the /etc , ex : /etc/Rand
	4 - the package directory itself.

    - The package directory is defined by :
	1 - the value of "-package" calling parameter (see --help output)
	2 - the value of "RAND_PACKG" environement variable
	3 - the directory of the Rand editor executable file.

    The output of --help option could be used to see where the editor
    expects to found the configuration files, and the name of these files.

To do a local customization of the keyboard definition,
-------------------------------------------------------
    for the system : copy the /usr/local/Rand/kbfiles directory into
	/usr/local/etc/Rand or /etc/Rand directory
    for a defined user : copy the /usr/local/Rand/kbfiles directory into
	$HOME/.Rand directory
    The content of /usr/local/Rand/kbfiles must not be edited, these files
	could be modified during installation of a new release.

Instalation with the RPM package manager :
------------------------------------------

    The package can be realocated into a user define directory instead of
	/usr/local default installation directory
    with the "--prefix <install directory>"
    or "--relocate /usr/local=<install directory>"
    parameter of the rpm call
