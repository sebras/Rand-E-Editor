This version of the rand editor currently compiles on the
following architectures:

- Linux  2.*, (ReadHat 6.* distribution) for i386 familly
- AIX    4.x
- Solaris (Sun OS 5.*) on sun hardware
- LynxOS (RT kernel), Posix complient, version 3.* for PowerPC

As it is there, it does look any more for special files in /ps/local/$OS/e
where $OS = AIX, ULTRIX or OSF1 (as reported by uname)

Local dependencies are defined by the dynamicaly generated file 'e19/e.r.c"
by the 'e19/NewVersion' shell script. This script take is parameters
from the calling Makefile.

The 'NewVersion'shell script need the 'bash' shell program.
To update this script on a given target computer according to the
local environment use 'make local' in the top level package directory.

Installation and configuration :
================================

The new version for Linux and AIX use a new way to found the keyboard
configuration.

    - The full path name of the keyboard file is defined by
      (in priority order)
	1 - the value of "-kbfile" calling parameter (see --help output)
	2 - the value of "EKBFILE" environment variable
	3 - the "<package configuration>/kbfiles/<terminal type file name>"
	    the "terminal type keyboard configuration file name"

    - The "terminal type file name" configuration is defined
	1 - the name of the terminal defined by
		i  - the value of "-terminal" calling parameter (see --help output)
		ii - the value of "TERM" environment variable
	    concanetated with the postfix "kb",
	    ex : linuxkb for the default linux console
	2 - "universalkb" if the specific file does not exist
	    or cannot be read.

    - The "package configuration directory" is defined by
	1 - the user configuration directory : ".Rand" in the
	    user $HOME directory, ex : <toto home>/.Rand
	2 - the local system configuration directory : "Rand"
	    in the /usr/local/etc , ex : /usr/local/etc/Rand
	3 - the global system configuration directory : "Rand"
	    in the /etc , ex : /etc/Rand
	4 - the package directory itself.

    - The package directory is defined by :
	1 - the value of "-package" calling parameter (see --help output)
	2 - the value of "RAND_PACKG" environment variable
	3 - the directory of the Rand editor executable file.

    The output of --help option could be used to see where the editor
    expects to found the configuration files, and the name of these files.

To do a local customization of the keyboard definition,
-------------------------------------------------------
    for the system : copy the /usr/local/Rand/kbfiles directory into
	/usr/local/etc/Rand or /etc/Rand directory
    for a defined user : copy the /usr/local/Rand/kbfiles directory into
	$HOME/.Rand directory
    The content of /usr/local/Rand/kbfiles must not be edited, these files
	could be modified during installation of a new release.

  New feature for customization of the keyboard definition (version >= E19.52)
    Keyboard configuration files can use '#include <file name>' directive
      to import common definition, and latter overwrite some of the 'included'
      definition by specific one. If the 'file name' does not start with
      a '/' character, the file name path is relative to the current
      including file, else it is an absolute file name path.

Installation specific case :
============================
  The linux installation is done normally with the RPM package manager :

    The package can be relocated into a user define directory instead of
	/usr/local default installation directory
    with the "--prefix <install directory>"
    or "--relocate /usr/local=<install directory>"
    parameter of the rpm call


  Installation on system which does not provide rpm package management facility.
    The installation is done with the "make preinstall" and "make install"
    (using gmake program).
    It can be necessary to edit the Makefile file (in the Rand source root
    directory) to reflect the local file system structure.


Note for Rand Editor developpers :
==================================

  Before using Makfile to compile the rand editor, it is mandatory to
  run the local.sh (Born) shell script. This script update the other
  script which are using the bash shell with the local full path name
  of the bash shell. It allow also to modifie the local name of the Rand
  editor (see output of "./local.sh --help").

  The shell script new_release.sh (which use bask shell) is provide
  to generate updated version of files for a new revision of
  the rand Editor version E19.
  It update the RPM specification file, the top level Makefile and
  the e19/NewVersion shell script.
  This new_release.sh script can be used also to do a simple consistency
  check of revsion number between these 3 files.

  The GNU make is needed to run the Makefiles of the distribution.
    The if facility of GNU make is used to define somme flags for
    the various OS targets.
  The GNU tar and install programs are used by the Makefile, some specific
    features of these gnu pacakages are used to produce the compressed tar
    file and to install the Rand editor package.

  NOX11 and NOXKB conditional compilation flags can be used to exclude
    X11 library or X11 Keyboard extension during compilation, loading.
