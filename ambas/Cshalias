The following Cshell alias can be useful for
use with the Ambassador:

    alias aaa    'setenv TERM aaa\!^; tset -e -Q'

Beware that there is a control-H immediately after the -e in
the previous example.

What you do is issue a command like

    aaa 30

and the aaa alias sets TERM and does a tset.
