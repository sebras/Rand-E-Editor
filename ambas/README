'ambas' is a program to restore the
keyboard of the Ambassador after running
the Rand Editor.  Some day when it is
finished, it will be usable to set and
restore the state of the whole terminal.

For now, it just sets the keys
and strings to the powerup condition.

'termcap' has our termcap entry for
the Ambassador, which works for E and vi.
